static std::string aboutText = R"(           An emulator environment for CHIP-8 derivates


Cadmium allows loading and running files for various CHIP-8 derivates,
as well as developing software for them using Octo assembler language.

# Supported Variants

Currently supported CHIP-8 variants are:
  * CHIP-8
  * CHIP-10
  * CHIP-48
  * SUPERCHIP 1.0
  * SUPERCHIP 1.1
  * MegaChip8
  * XO-CHIP

Besides selecting a CHIP-8 variant it is possible to configure various
quirks and behaviors to further tweak compatibility for a special
CHIP-8 rom.

# File Extensions Detected

Cadmium automatically switches to specific presets depending on the
file type of files loaded:
  '*.ch8' - This is the generic form and the current preset is not
            changed
  '*.sc8' - SUPERCHIP 1.1
  '*.mc8' - MegaChip8
  '*.xo8' - XO-CHIP
  '*.8o'  - This is opened as Octo source file into the editor and
            instantly assembled to a binary if possible
  '*.c8b' - Experimental support for CHIP-8 binary format files
            as described at:
            https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-binary-format

# Editor

Cadmium contains an editor to allow writing CHIP-8 programs or
modifying existing code. ROMs loaded into Cadmium are automatically
disassembled and made available in the editor. While the disassembler
uses speculative execution, it still might not lead to the optimal
result, e.g. in case of self modifying code or calculated branches
that speculative execution didn't have enough information to get.

The editor supports the typical key combinations with CTRL, so copy,
cut and paste are C, X and V, CTRL-A selects all text.

Changes are automatically compiled, errors are currently shown in the
status line. So if "No errors." is shown, the code is the one executed
when starting emulation and changing the code resets the emulator
status.

# Special Credits

Cadmium started as a "Well I guess I should at least implement CHIP-8
once" project, after I already privately had fun writing emulators
But the combined early reactions from the raylib Discord and the
Emulation Development Discord gave me so much fun that I started to
dig more into the subject. So first of all a big thank you to all
those who pushed me with their nice comments and inspirational
remarks, I can't name you all but it really did kick off this project.

I still want to give out some explicit thanks to:

* Ramon Santamaria (@raysan5) - I stumbled across raylib at the end
  of 2021 and since 2022 I started using it for some experiments and
  then took part in the raylib game jam and had so much fun. Without
  raylib I wouldn't have started this, it was originally a test bed
  for my raygui wrapper but instead became a life of its own.
  https://raylibtech.itch.io

* John Earnest (@JohnEarnest) - For his great Octo and for XO-Chip,
  while I still would have loved for some things to be different in
  Octo Assembly Syntax, I really appreciate that this new variant
  got CHIP-8 development to a more modern leve, made it more
  accessible and together with the great web based IDE at
  https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/
  gave CHIP-8 a new live and the OctoJam idea sure helped pushing
  it, thank you for that! His C-Octo implementation of the assembler
  also is embedded in Cadmium and drives its assembling capabilities:
  https://github.com/JohnEarnest/c-octo

* Tim Franssen (@Timendus) - For his "CHIP-8 Test Suite" helped me a
  great deal in finding issues and get a better understanding of the
  quirks that differentiate the CHIP-8 variants:
  https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite
  and for his work on a binary CHIP-8 container that could carray
  emulation parameter allowing easy set-up for roms, more info at:
  https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite

* @NinjaWeedle - For his great help and countless tests to get some
  flesh on the very skinny original MegaChip8 specs to allow actually
  support this exotic CHIP-8 variant ant maybe help it to be more
  accepted. His work resulted in documentation and tests on:
  https://github.com/NinjaWeedle/MegaChip8

* @Kouzeru and for pushing me into supporting XO-Audio and the
  creative discussions on where to go with future chip
  https://github.com/Kouzeru/

* Joshua Moss (@Bandock) - for motivating me to implement and
  CDP1802 emulation core and getting "Support a real VIP mode"
  onto my todo list and for the interesting HyperChip64 ideas.
